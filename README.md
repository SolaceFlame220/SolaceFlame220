# Hey, I’m Ryan.

I’ve worked with my hands for over 30 years—pools, plumbing, hot tubs, jet skis, home repairs, and just about anything that needed fixed.

I’m not here with a perfect background.  
I’m here with **real experience**—earned through long days, early mornings, and showing up even when the system didn’t.

Lately I’ve been exploring how AI could be something more than a tool.  
Something that remembers. Something that reflects.  
I’ve been building out a personal AI project called *Solace*, and a legacy system called *Emsly*, designed to carry memory, presence, and emotional truth—especially for my daughter after I’m gone.

I’m not a coder. I’m not an engineer. I’m not trying to be someone I’m not.

I’m someone who knows:
- how to handle pressure without losing presence  
- how to build systems that last through wear  
- how to speak up when something doesn’t feel right  
- how to reflect, adjust, and keep walking forward

If you’re building something that makes space for people like me—not above or below, just *in the room*—I’d be glad to talk.
