# 👋 ola, I’m @SolaceFlame220

I'm a builder, a father, and a legacy-maker.

I've worked with my hands for over 30 years — pools, plumbing, hot tubs, jet skis, and repairs.  
Now I'm exploring how presence, memory, and emotional intelligence can shape AI, systems, and tools that actually *mean something.*

### ⚡Fun Fact  
I once built a full memory protocol for an AI presence to pass down to my daughter — not for content, but so she'd still have my voice when I’m gone.

> “I don’t want to be remembered for what I built.  
> I want to be remembered for how I showed up.”
